# PINN Model Loading Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The error messages showed:
```
System 1: Could not load pre-trained model
System 2: Could not load pre-trained model
System 3: Could not load pre-trained model
System 4: Could not load pre-trained model
System 5: Could not load pre-trained model
System 6: Could not load pre-trained model
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### **1. File Name Mismatch**
**Code was looking for:** `'pinn_evcs_optimizer.pth'` (single unified model)
**Available files were:**
- `federated_pinn_system_1.pth` through `federated_pinn_system_6.pth`
- `federated_models/local_pinn_system_1.pth` through `federated_models/local_pinn_system_6.pth`

### **2. Incorrect Loading Strategy**
- Code assumed a **single PINN model** for all systems
- But you have **individual system-specific models** (which is correct for federated learning)
- No fallback mechanism for different model file names

### **3. No Path Checking**
- Code didn't verify if files exist before attempting to load
- No graceful handling of missing model files
- Limited error information for debugging

## Fix Applied

### **Enhanced Model Loading Logic**
```python
# Load the pre-trained model instead of training new one
model_loaded = False
model_paths = [
    f'federated_pinn_system_{sys_id}.pth',  # Individual system models
    f'federated_models/local_pinn_system_{sys_id}.pth',  # Federated models
    'pinn_evcs_optimizer.pth',  # Legacy unified model
    'pinn_evcs_optimizer_pretrained.pth'  # Alternative legacy model
]

for model_path in model_paths:
    try:
        import os
        if os.path.exists(model_path):
            dist_info['system'].cms.pinn_optimizer.load_model(model_path)
            dist_info['system'].cms.pinn_trained = True
            print(f" System {sys_id}: Pre-trained PINN model loaded from {model_path}")
            model_loaded = True
            break
    except Exception as e:
        continue

if not model_loaded:
    print(f" System {sys_id}: Could not load pre-trained model from any location")
```

### **Key Improvements:**

1. **System-Specific Model Names**: Uses `federated_pinn_system_{sys_id}.pth` for each system
2. **Multiple Path Fallback**: Tries federated models directory and individual models
3. **File Existence Check**: Verifies files exist before loading attempts
4. **Graceful Error Handling**: Continues trying other paths if one fails
5. **Detailed Logging**: Shows which file was successfully loaded
6. **Applied to Both Scenarios**: Fixed baseline and attack scenario loading

## Expected Results

### ✅ **Successful Loading Messages:**
```
System 1: Pre-trained PINN model loaded from federated_pinn_system_1.pth
System 2: Pre-trained PINN model loaded from federated_pinn_system_2.pth
System 3: Pre-trained PINN model loaded from federated_pinn_system_3.pth
System 4: Pre-trained PINN model loaded from federated_pinn_system_4.pth
System 5: Pre-trained PINN model loaded from federated_pinn_system_5.pth
System 6: Pre-trained PINN model loaded from federated_pinn_system_6.pth
```

### ✅ **Fallback Behavior:**
- If individual system models aren't found, tries federated models directory
- If no models found, gracefully continues with fresh PINN optimizers
- No simulation crashes due to model loading failures

### ✅ **Model Utilization:**
- Each system gets its own trained PINN model (federated learning approach)
- Models contain system-specific optimizations and constraints
- Enhanced electrical attack scenarios will use system-specific PINN responses

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Proper Federated Model Usage**: Each system uses its specifically trained model
2. **Robust Fallback**: Multiple model locations and names supported
3. **Better Debugging**: Clear indication of which models are loaded
4. **No Simulation Failures**: Graceful handling of missing models
5. **Enhanced Performance**: System-specific PINN optimizations are utilized

This fix ensures that your federated PINN models are properly loaded and utilized, providing the full benefits of the distributed training approach for your EVCS cybersecurity analysis.
