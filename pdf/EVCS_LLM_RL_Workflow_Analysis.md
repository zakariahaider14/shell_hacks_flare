    "vulnerabilities": [
        {
            "vuln_id": "VULN_001",
            "component": "charging_controller",
            "vulnerability_type": "Authentication Bypass",
            "severity": 0.85,

```python
# Example Attack Strategy from LLM
{
    "strategy_name": "Coordinated EVCS Disruption Campaign",
    "attack_sequence": [
        {
            "step": 1,

            "success_probability": 0.85,
            "stealth_level": "high"
        },
        {
            "step": 2,
            "action": "initial_access",
            "target": "charging_controller",

    "communication_status": [0, 1],           # Binary communication state
    "security_level": [0.0, 1.0],             # Security posture
    "vulnerability_exploited": [0, 1],        # Binary exploit status
    "attack_progress": [0.0, 1.0],            # Attack completion percentage
    "detection_risk": [0.0, 1.0],             # Risk of being detected
    "system_resilience": [0.0, 1.0]           # System's defensive capability
}

# DQN Action Space
action_space = {
    "reconnaissance": 0,      # Gather information
    "exploit_vulnerability": 1,  # Execute exploit
    "maintain_persistence": 2,   # Stay hidden
    "escalate_privileges": 3,    # Gain more access
    "exfiltrate_data": 4,        # Steal information

# PPO explores continuous action spaces
continuous_actions = {
    "attack_intensity": [0.0, 1.0],        # How aggressive the attack
    "stealth_effort": [0.0, 1.0],          # How much to hide
    "resource_allocation": [0.0, 1.0],     # How to distribute effort
    "timing_strategy": [0.0, 1.0]          # When to execute actions
}
```

       attack_success_bonus * 0.4 +           # Successful exploit
       stealth_bonus * 0.3 +                  # Avoiding detection
       impact_bonus * 0.2 +                   # System disruption
       efficiency_bonus * 0.1                 # Resource efficiency
   )
   ```

    # 1. RL Agent selects next action
    selected_action = self.rl_agent.select_action(current_state)
    
    # 2. Apply evasion techniques
    evaded_action = self.apply_evasion_techniques(selected_action)
    
    # 3. Execute attack step
    result = self.execute_attack_step(evaded_action)
    
    # 4. Update system state
    new_state = self.update_system_state(result)
    
    # 5. Calculate reward and learn
    reward = self.calculate_reward(result, new_state)
    self.rl_agent.learn(current_state, selected_action, reward, new_state)
    
    return result
```
